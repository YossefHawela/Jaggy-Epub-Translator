# Jaggy Epub Translator
A no-nonsense tool that batch-translates .epub files (currently using Google Translate). It rips out the content, feeds it to the translator, and stitches it back togetherâ€”hopefully without destroying your precious formatting. Ideal for light novels, web novels, or anything else where you're too lazy to wait for official translations.
