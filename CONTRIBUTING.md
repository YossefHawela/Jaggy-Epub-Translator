So, you want to fix my mess or make it worse? Cool. Here’s how:

1. **Fork it** — Yeah, don’t break my repo directly.
2. **Make your changes** — Try not to trash everything.
3. **Commit like a pro** — Write a decent commit message, not “fix stuff.”
4. **Push to your fork** — Upload your masterpiece.
5. **Open a Pull Request** — Show me what you broke or fixed.

**Note:**

* I’ll ignore your PRs if they’re garbage or break everything worse.
* Keep it clean, keep it jaggy, but don’t be an idiot.
* If you’re here for the fame or to slack off, go away.

Happy hacking, or not.
